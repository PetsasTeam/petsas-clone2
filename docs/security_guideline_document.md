# Implementation Plan for Cyprus Car Rental Website

## 1. Planning & Requirements

**Objectives:** Finalize scope, align stakeholders, perform threat modeling.

- Gather and validate detailed functional requirements.
- Prioritize features: booking, payments, user accounts, admin roles.
- Security-by-Design:
  - Conduct threat modeling (STRIDE) to identify risks.
  - Define roles & permissions (RBAC: Super-Admin, Branch Manager, Customer).
  - Draft GDPR data‐processing agreement and privacy policy.

## 2. Architecture & Design

**Deliverables:** System architecture diagram, API spec, database schema.

- **System Architecture:**
  - React SPA + Node.js/Express API + PostgreSQL + AWS S3/RDS.
  - Layered design (presentation, business logic, data access).
- **API Design:**
  - RESTful endpoints with versioning (`/api/v1/...`).
  - OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for documentation.
- **Database Schema:**
  - Tables: Users, Roles, Vehicles, Locations, Bookings, Extras, PricingRules, Payments, PromoCodes.
  - Enforce foreign‐key constraints and normalized data model.
- **Security Controls:**
  - Least‐privilege DB users.
  - Input validation rules (e.g., Joi schemas).
  - Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).

## 3. Frontend Implementation

**Tech Stack:** React, React DatePicker, i18next, CSS Modules/styled-components.

- **Setup & Tooling:**
  - Initialize React project with Create React App or Vite.
  - Integrate i18next for English/Russian translations.
  - Enforce ESLint/Prettier for code quality.
- **Features:**
  - **Booking Flow:** Calendar component, location pickers, availability status.
  - **Vehicle Listings & Details:** Photo carousel, specs, dynamic pricing.
  - **Extras & Insurance:** Checkbox selectors, live price updates.
  - **Checkout & Payment:** Secure form, summary, redirect to JCC.
  - **User Profile:** Booking history, profile update.
- **Security Controls:**
  - Content Security Policy (CSP).
  - Sanitize and encode all user‐rendered data to prevent XSS.
  - Protect against CSRF using double-submit cookies or CSRF tokens.
  - Strict CORS: allow only the frontend domain.
  - Secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).

## 4. Backend Implementation

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL.

- **Project Setup:**
  - Use TypeScript for type safety.
  - Organize code into modules: auth, bookings, vehicles, payments, admin.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - JWT with strong secret, HS256 or RS256, short TTL, refresh tokens.
  - Enforce RBAC middleware: verify user roles on each endpoint.
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt/Argon2 + unique salt.
  - Implement account lockout/brute‐force protection and optional MFA.
- **Data Access & Validation:**
  - Use parameterized queries with a reputable ORM (e.g., TypeORM/Knex).
  - Validate all inputs server‐side (Joi/Zod).
- **Payment Integration:**
  - Integrate JCC via server‐to‐server API calls.
  - Do not store sensitive card data (redirect or tokenization).
  - Enforce PCI-DSS scope reduction.
- **Security Controls:**
  - Enforce HTTPS for all API traffic.
  - Rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit) on authentication and booking endpoints.
  - Helmet.js for secure headers (`HSTS`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).
  - Detailed but non-revealing error handling; centralized error logger.

## 5. Database & Storage

- **PostgreSQL RDS:**
  - Enable encryption at rest and in transit.
  - Automated backups and point‐in‐time recovery.
  - DB user roles with least privilege (read‐only vs read‐write).
- **AWS S3 for Asset Storage:**
  - Store vehicle images & documents outside webroot.
  - Use pre-signed URLs with short TTL for uploads/downloads.
  - Bucket policies and IAM roles with least privilege.

## 6. Admin Panel & Management Tools

- Build a secure React‐based admin dashboard:
  - Vehicle CRUD, location management, pricing rules, promo codes.
  - Branch managers scoped only to their locations.
- Protect endpoints with RBAC and audit trails.
- Log admin actions for accountability.

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - Jest/Mocha for backend; React Testing Library for frontend.
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Cypress or Playwright for booking flows and payment redirect.
- **Security Testing:**
  - SAST (ESLint security rules, npm audit, Snyk).
  - DAST/Penetration testing for OWASP Top 10.
  - Vulnerability scanning of Docker images and dependencies.

## 8. CI/CD & Deployment

- **CI Pipeline:**
  - GitHub Actions: lint → test → build → security scan.
- **CD Pipeline:**
  - Build Docker images, push to ECR.
  - Deploy to ECS/EKS or EC2 Auto Scaling Group with Terraform.
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager or Vault for credentials.
- **Infrastructure Security:**
  - VPC with private subnets for RDS, public load balancer for ECS.
  - Security groups: least-open ports (443 only).
  - Automated TLS certificates via AWS ACM/Let’s Encrypt.

## 9. Monitoring, Logging & Maintenance

- **Logging & Metrics:**
  - Centralized logs (AWS CloudWatch, ELK stack).
  - Application metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) for latency, error rates.
- **Alerts & Incident Response:**
  - PagerDuty or SNS for critical security events.
- **Ongoing Security Hygiene:**
  - Monthly dependency updates and vulnerability patching.
  - Quarterly pen testing and compliance reviews (GDPR, PCI-DSS scope).
  - Regular backups and disaster recovery drills.

---
**Timeline Estimate:**  
Phase 1 (Requirements & Design): 2 weeks  
Phase 2 (MVP Development): 8–10 weeks  
Phase 3 (Testing & Hardening): 4 weeks  
Phase 4 (Deployment & Stabilization): 2 weeks  
**Total:** ~16–18 weeks

This plan embeds security controls at every layer—aligning with security-by-design, least privilege, defense in depth, and secure defaults to deliver a robust, maintainable car rental platform.
